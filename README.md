Abstract : 

In this project we introduces a breast cancer detection system leveraging image processing and machine learning. We utilize Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest classifiers, employing VGG16 for feature extraction. Mammograms undergo preprocessing for quality enhancement, with VGG16 capturing discriminative features. Comparative analysis reveals promising accuracy, enhancing early and accurate breast cancer detection.
